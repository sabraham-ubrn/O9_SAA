How can I do seeding in class plan for LY?,"I see multiple FAQs that might be relevant to this question!

Based on the provided context, here's my answer:

You can seed all your classes with LY at one time by selecting multiple classes in your Seed Plan Action Button Parameters. This is true for parent/child relationships at any level of the hierarchy (e.g., all classes in a department, departments in a division, divisions in a brand, etc.).

Additionally, you can also choose to seed from LY/LLY/LLLY/AVG3LY of a Like Class in the Seed Plan action button.

Note that there's no mention of specific requirements or limitations for seeding plans with LY data. However, it's worth noting that when seeding from a like class, it is seeding from the plan time frame (WP), not the LY of the like class itself.",negative
